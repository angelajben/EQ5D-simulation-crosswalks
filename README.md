# EQ5D-simulation-crosswalks
This project aims to assess the impact of using EQ-5D value sets or crosswalks on cost-utility outcomes using trial-based economic evaluations simulated data.
EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L were simulated using the EQ-5D simulation laboratory R package developed by Parkin et al.
Covariates (i.e., age, gender, treatment allocation, and costs) were simulated using the simstudy R package.
